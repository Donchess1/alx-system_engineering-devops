Issues with the Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

2. Downtime During Maintenance:

When performing maintenance, such as deploying new code or restarting the web server, the website may experience downtime.

3. Limited Scalability:

The current infrastructure may struggle to handle a large volume of incoming traffic. Scaling options, such as load balancing and horizontal scaling, are not implemented in this design.
